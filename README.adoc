This project provides the JavaScript API implementation for Vert.x using the Nashorn JavaScript engine built into Java 8.

As with all Vert.x 3 language implementations they are generated from a Java API using templates - this allows us to
maintain just the canonical Java APIs which is a lot less work than maintaining them manually.

This project provides a verticle factory implementation which knows how to deploy verticles with the prefix, or file
extension `js`.
